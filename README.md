# CS333
 My coursework for CS333: Programming Languages taught during Spring 2021 at Colby College.
 
Note that any code written in the C programming language is authored exclusively by Tyler Hansen, whereas work in other languages such as Rust, Go, Ruby, etc. is a collaborative effort between [Tyler](https://github.com/tylermhansen), [Sawyer Strong](https://github.com/sawyerstrong), and [Skye Rhomberg](https://github.com/hadokat).
