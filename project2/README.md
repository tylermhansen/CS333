## CS333 Project 2

### Tyler Hansen, Sawyer Strong, Skye Rhomberg

NOTE: All work conducted in the C programming language found in this repository is strictly the work of Tyler Hansen. Code written in Rust, Go, Ruby, or any other programming language is a collaborative effort between the three of us.

I highly recommend that this repository is [viewed on GitHub](https://github.com/tylermhansen/CS333), as I have individual `README.md` files for each subdirectory crediting the authorss.

#### Directory Guide:

```
/project2
├── README.md <-- You are here! (If you have the README open, of course. In GitHub, you will see this if you are just in the /project2 directory.)

#### Extensions:
