## CS333 Project 2: Work In Ruby

### Tyler Hansen, Sawyer Strong, and Skye Rhomberg

This week's task for extra programming languages was to write a hello world program (found in `helloworld.rb`) and to do something cool/interesting with the language.

We decided to make a random dog fact generator to show how simple complicated issues like HTTP requests can be in Ruby due to `gems`. Gems are basically Ruby libraries/packages. More information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems).

To run the dog fact generator, just run `ruby dogfact.rb` in this directory (`.../ruby_work`).
